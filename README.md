# One More Motivation to Use Evaluation Tools<br>  This Time for Hardware Multiplicative Masking of AES

This repository contains source codes and results related to the article [One More Motivation to Use Evaluation Tools, This Time for Hardware Multiplicative Masking of AES](www.empty.com).

## Short Description

This work focuses on the security evaluation of [Multiplicative masking for AES
in hardware](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/7282). Leveraging the [PROLEAD tool](https://github.com/ChairImpSec/PROLEAD), we analyzed vulnerabilities in the Kronecker delta function under the glitch-extended and glitch + transition-extended probing models. Our findings revealed critical leakage due to randomness optimization, which we addressed by proposing and validating optimized solutions to ensure first-order security.

This repository provides the source code for the proposed designs, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive results supporting our conclusions.
