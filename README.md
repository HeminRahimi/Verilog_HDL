**Sample Timing Offset Estimation**


**Project Description:**

This project aims to provide an efficient estimation of Sample Timing Offset (STO) Estimation  in communication systems.


**Notes:**

- This version is not necessarily synthesizable.

- Designed using VIVADO 2022.1.

- If using a different version of VIVADO, you may need to redesign IPs based on your current version.

- A version of this project has also been provided in MATLAB (in live script). You can use the MATLAB file for data generation.

**Features:**

- Accurate sample timing offset estimation

- Implementation based on robust methodology

- Designed for VIVADO 2022.1
