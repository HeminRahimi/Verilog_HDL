**Sample Timing Offset Estimation**

**Project Description:**

This project aims to efficiently estimate Sample Timing Offset Estimation (STO) in communication systems.


**Notes:**

- This version is not necessarily synthesizable.

- Designed using VIVADO 2022.1.

- If using a different version of VIVADO, you may need to redesign IPs based on your current version.

- A version of this project has also been provided in MATLAB (in live script). You can use the MATLAB file to generate data.

**Features:**

Accurate sample timing offset estimation

Implementation based on robust methodology

Designed for VIVADO 2022.1
